# Changes to this project

- Change tailwind config to use css variables and inject them in the app rather than having static values for colors and theming, that includes add css variables into global.css
- Change project to use vitest rather than jest
- Add react testing library
- Use screaming architecture inside of the app folder
- Get rid of expo and change to react native cli and react navigation
- See how to make different configurations for each app in terms of the app.config (expo especific) and the tailwind css variables, maybe a configuration.json file that we fetch and inject into the app
- Simple action
  - Get locations from user
  - App token, we can inject that here for now
